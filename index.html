				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<p class="two-col">In 2016 John Smith, President and CEO of Wanderlust Travels, opened his travel company in a small basement office in the Town Hall with 2 employees. Today, we employ over 50 people in 4 locations, New Delhi, London, Winnipeg and Toronto. Prior to opening Wanderlust Travels, John spent 4 years in education at the high school level. As a teacher, he organized school trips for students which sparked his interest in travel and he has never looked back. Wanderlust Travels is one of the largest travel agencies in Canada yet has all the advantages of a small-town business: friendly, personal attention, long-serving employees and a superior level of expertise and service.

				Our goal is to provide you with travel memories that will enrich your life.  Remember how you gasped with wonder at the Pyramids in Egypt, the feeling of pure joy as you watched a herd of elephants bathe a newborn calf or the adrenaline rush you felt as you gazed at the valley below after your hike to the top of Machu Picchu?  The world is out there and is yours to discover.  Let us help you find your memories while minimizing your footprint on our precious planet!</p>
